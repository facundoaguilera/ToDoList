# ToDoList
a To Do List App
Wellcome!
To run this app you only need to download the api folder, make sure the env folder or you will have to create a virtual enviroment with name env
with the requirements that the requirements.txt file indicate.
Then in a git bash you can type ./server.sh standing in the api folder.
This was made using django rest and react.js
I hope ypu like it!
